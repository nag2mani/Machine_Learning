    "- Write a Python code to implement Linear Regression for multi-dimensional input and one-dimensional output using Matrix Inverse. You can use NumPy to do matrix inverse, but you are encouraged to write your own code for this task also.\n",

    "- Find the best fit hyperplane for the four synthetic datasets attached. Two of them will directly give good results with the usual Linear Regression algo, one of them will require a non-linear transformation of the input features, and for one of them the standard Linear Regression algo is not suitable. You need to figure out which of the 4 datasets belongs to which of these categories, with proper reasoning."
